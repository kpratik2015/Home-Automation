# Bump the Homebrew cask in the homebrew-whatcable tap to point at a new release.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-cask.sh <version> <zip-path>
#
# Configuration (via env or .env):
#   TAP_DIR              Path to the homebrew-whatcable repo. Required.
#   CASK_AUTOPUSH        If "1", run `git push` after committing. Default: 0.
#   CASK_VERIFY_REMOTE   If "1", download the asset from the GitHub release URL
#                        the cask points at and verify its sha256 matches the
#                        local zip before committing. Default: 0 (since the
#                        release usually isn't published yet at build time).
#                        Use this after publishing: re-run with =1 to confirm
#                        the uploaded asset is byte-identical to what was built.
#   CASK_VERIFY_STRICT   If "1" and CASK_VERIFY_REMOTE=1, treat a 404 (asset not
#                        yet uploaded) as a hard error rather than a warning.
#
# Skipped silently if TAP_DIR is unset, so build-app.sh can call it unconditionally.
