/// The model is deliberately a value type fed one observation at a time. The
/// platform watcher owns a `var monitor = SessionMonitor()` and calls
/// `monitor.record(_:)` each poll; the verdict is then read off `verdict`.
/// Keeping it pure (no `Date`, no IOKit, no I/O) is what lets the replay
/// tests drive a whole session as a plain array of observations and assert
/// exactly when it does, and does not, go red.
///
/// **Asymmetry (load-bearing).** Measurement can *confirm* delivery cheaply
/// but must only *convict* on corroborated evidence:
/// - one transient bad poll (a reseat, a current spike) never reaches red,
/// - a host or device limit is never the cable's fault and never reaches red,
/// - red needs either a degradation that *repeats* (dropped, recovered,
///   dropped again) or one that is *sustained* well past a debounce window,
///   or resistance that stays out of the spec budget under load.
