/// would otherwise be silently dropped. Two cases:
///
/// 1. Devices reached over a Thunderbolt tunnel (issue #274), behind a TB dock
///    or display. The helper nests them under the host port when exactly one
///    Thunderbolt device is connected, else renders flat.
/// 2. Devices behind an internal Apple USB hub (issue #348), the front USB-C
///    and USB-A ports on Mac mini / Studio / Pro. These never nest under a
///    port: front ports have no port-controller silicon to attribute to.
///
/// Safety rule for the TB-tunnelled nesting: only attribute to a port when
/// **exactly one** Thunderbolt device is connected. With one connection there
/// is no ambiguity about what the tunnelled devices are behind, so the
/// attribution is certain without the per-port tunnel join (the
/// `apciec`/`acio` correlation that is not yet confirmed on multi-port
/// hardware). With two or more Thunderbolt devices the helper returns no
/// host port and the caller renders a flat "Other USB devices" section
/// instead of guessing.
///
/// Pure logic, no IOKit. Shared by the menu bar app, the CLI text output, and
/// the JSON output so all three group identically.
