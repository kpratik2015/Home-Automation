/// Decide whether a port is physically live based on the union of IOKit
/// watcher state (devices, power sources, PD identities) and the port-level
/// `ConnectionActive` flag.
///
/// Why this helper exists:
///
/// - `AppleHPMInterface.connectionActive` lingers `true` for several seconds after
///   unplug on MagSafe (`AppleHPMInterfaceType11`), so we can't trust it
///   alone there.
/// - The power source watcher caches the last negotiated PDO, so a port
///   with nothing plugged in can still expose a USB-PD source long after
///   the cable was removed (issue #47).
///
/// So we treat each signal differently. Devices and PD identities are
/// strong: their watchers terminate on real IOKit notifications, no
/// caching. The port-level `connectionActive` flag is trusted on
/// non-MagSafe. Power sources need corroboration before they count.
///
/// MagSafe is the awkward one. Normally a connected MagSafe charger exposes a
/// per-port power source (the negotiated PDO), which corroborates liveness.
/// But in rare cases macOS produces no per-port power source for a genuinely
/// connected MagSafe charger (one machine in the corpus; reporter Yee Zhang),
/// and then the port has nothing to corroborate and reads as "nothing
/// connected". MagSafe's `connectionActive` does report the connection, but it
/// also lingers `true` for seconds after unplug (issue #47), so it can't be
/// trusted on its own. The tie-breaker is `chargerAttached`: whether the Mac
/// actually has an external adapter attached right now. That clears immediately
/// on unplug, so it rules out the lingering case while still surfacing a
/// genuinely connected MagSafe charger even when no per-port source appears.
///
/// - Parameter chargerAttached: whether an external charger is attached to the
///   Mac. Used only to corroborate a MagSafe `connectionActive`. Defaults to
///   `false` so callers that can't supply it keep the prior behaviour.
