    // exactly (vid/pid must be "0x"-prefixed strings that parse as hex and
    // are both non-zero): 231 distinct (VID, PID) pairs across every folder's
    // `devices` + `cables` arrays. Floor = 85% of 231, rounded down:
    // 231 * 0.85 = 196.35 -> 196.
    //
    // An earlier scoping pass (used only to gauge scale before this file was
    // written, not the filter that shipped) had counted 268 by checking the
    // vid/pid strings were merely non-empty rather than non-zero, so it
    // counted zero-VID/zero-PID entries (e.g. `"0x0000"`/`"0x0000"`) as a
    // valid pair. This file's actual filter excludes those (mirroring
    // `CableDB.curatedCables`'s own zero-VID/PID guard, see the doc comment
    // above), so 268 never matched what the shipped code counts; 231 is the
    // correct figure for the filter actually in this file.

    // sweeps depend on), so this floor never skips on a fresh clone.
